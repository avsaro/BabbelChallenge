# Babbel Challenge

#### Time management on challenge

A total of 6 hours has been spent for the project. Time has been spent evenly between studying requirements, conceptualizing how to achieve requirements and writing code and tests.

#### Decisions made 

I decided not to use any third party dependency in challenge. Because of the facts there was no clear necessity and time saving opportunities out of the native cocoa frameworks and also I decided I sould not outsource any part of the requirements for the purpose of the challenge.

#### Decisions made because of restricted time 

While there are aspect of the project can be made better with more time, there was no technical decision or design choices made because of time limit.

#### If I would spend more time

These are things I would add to project if I would spend more time. Sorted by their importance
 - Safety checks against malformed database. Currently I assume 'words.json' file does not have any empty or unreadable record.
 - I would keep word pairs shown to user in a list so same pairs would not be shown to user in same session.
 - Better visual feedbacks can be prepared to user all around the game.

#### Good to know

Milestones are marked in git repository as tags.
